            <p>Last updated: October 28, 2025</p>

           <!--  <div class="disclaimer">
                <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This is a template for Terms and Conditions. It is not legal advice. You should consult with a legal professional to ensure your terms are complete and compliant with local laws.
            </div> -->

            <h3>1. Agreement to Terms</h3>
            <p>By accessing and using our website (the "Site"), you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, you must not use our Site.</p>

            <h3>2. Products and Pricing</h3>
            <p>We strive to display product information, including images and descriptions, as accurately as possible. However, we do not guarantee that colors, details, or prices will be completely accurate. All prices are listed in Kenyan Shillings (KES) and are subject to change without notice. We reserve the right to discontinue any product at any time.</p>

            <h3>3. Orders and Payment</h3>
            <p>Placing an item in your cart does not reserve it. An order is only confirmed after you complete the checkout process and receive a confirmation email. We accept payments via M-Pesa, Credit/Debit Cards, and other specified mobile money services. We reserve the right to refuse or cancel any order for any reason, including limitations on quantities available for purchase or inaccuracies in product information.</p>

            <h3>4. Shipping and Delivery</h3>
            <p>We ship to locations within Kenya. Delivery times are estimates and begin from the date of shipping, not the date of order. We are not responsible for delays caused by the courier or for lost/stolen packages after delivery has been confirmed.</p>

            <h3>5. Returns and Refunds</h3>
            <p>We accept returns within 7 days of the delivery date. To be eligible for a return, items must be unused, in the same condition that you received them, and with all original tags attached. The customer is responsible for return shipping costs unless the item was incorrect or defective. Refunds will be processed to the original method of payment.</p>

            <h3>6. User Accounts</h3>
            <p>If you create an account on our Site, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password. You agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account. You must provide accurate and complete information and keep your account information updated.</p>

            <h3>7. Intellectual Property</h3>
